# CUDA Installations and Framework Bindings<a name="overview-cuda"></a>

Deep learning is all pretty cutting edge, however, each framework offers "stable" versions\. These stable versions may not work with the latest CUDA or cuDNN implementation and features\. How do you decide? This ultimately points to your use case and the features you require\. If you are not sure, then go with the latest [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](conda.md)\. It has official pip binaries of all frameworks with both CUDA 8 and CUDA 9, using whichever most recent version is supported by each framework\. 

Look at our guide on [Stable versus Bleeding Edge](overview-conda.md#overview-conda-stability) for further guidance\.

**CUDA Support**  
The Deep Learning AMI with Source Code's CUDA version and the frameworks supported for each:

+ [Deep Learning AMI with CUDA 9](cuda9.md): Apache MXNet, Caffe2, PyTorch, TensorFlow

+ [Deep Learning AMI with CUDA 8](cuda8.md): Apache MXNet, Caffe, Caffe2, CNTK, PyTorch, Theano, TensorFlow, and Torch

Specific framework version numbers can be found in the [DLAMI: Release Notes](appendix-ami-release-notes.md)

Choose this DLAMI type or learn more about the different DLAMIs with the Next Up option\.

Choose one of the CUDA versions and review the full list of DLAMIs that have that version in the Appendix, or learn more about the different DLAMIs with the Next Up option\.
