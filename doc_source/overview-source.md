# Deep Learning AMI with Source Code<a name="overview-source"></a>

Deep Learning AMI with Source Code refers to DLAMIs that use one Python environment for all of the frameworks\. Technically, there are two environments, Python 2\.7 and Python 3\.5, and the frameworks are installed once into each of those Python versions\. This DLAMI also has the source code for the frameworks, making it a larger disk image\. It is often used by someone who plans to modify the source code directly, or contributors to the frameworks' open source projects\.
