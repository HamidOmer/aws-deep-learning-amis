# Deep Learning AMI with Conda<a name="overview-conda"></a>

The newest DLAMI uses Anaconda environments\. These environments are configured to keep the different framework installations separate\. It also makes it easy to switch between frameworks\. This is great for learning and experimenting with all of the frameworks the DLAMI has to offer\. One limitation is that you can't write a program that uses multiple frameworks at the same time\. As this is a fairly advanced kind of situation, most users never encounter this\. With this in mind, most users find that the new Deep Learning AMI with Conda is perfect for them\. 

These "Conda" AMIs will be the primary DLAMIs\. It will be updated often with the latest versions from the frameworks, and have the latest GPU drivers and software\. It will be generally referred to as *the* AWS Deep Learning AMI in most documents\.

Choose this DLAMI type or learn more about the different DLAMIs with the Next Up option\.
