## How to Get Started with the DLAMI<a name="getting-started"></a>

Getting started is easy\. Included in this guide are tips on picking the DLAMI that's right for you, selecting an instance type that fits your use case and budget, and [Resources and Support](resources.md) that describe custom setups that may be of interest\. Or you can go straight to the latest DLAMI on the AWS Marketplace, [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md), and spin up an instance from there\.

If you're new to using AWS or using Amazon EC2, start with the [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md)\. If you're familiar with Amazon EC2 and other AWS services like Amazon EMR, Amazon EFS, or Amazon S3, and are interested in integrating those services for projects that need distributed training or inference, then check out [Resources and Support](resources.md) to see if one fits your use case\. 

If you're already familiar with using AMIs and want to spin one up now, you can go to the AMI Marketplace now\. But first we recommend that you check out [Choosing Your DLAMI](options.md) to get an idea of which instance type might be best for your application\.
