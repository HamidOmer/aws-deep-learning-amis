# Choosing Your DLAMI<a name="options"></a>

If you run a search for deep learning in the AMI Marketplace, you may find there are many options, and it's not clear which is best suited for your use case\. This section helps you decide\. When we refer to a DLAMI, often this is really a group of AMIs centered around a common type or functionality\. There are three variables that define these types and/or functionality: 
+ Conda versus Source versus Base
+ CUDA 8 versus CUDA 9
+ Amazon Linux versus Ubuntu versus Windows

The rest of the topics in this guide will help further inform you and go into more details\.
