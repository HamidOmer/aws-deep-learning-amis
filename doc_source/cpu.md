# Recommended CPU Instances<a name="cpu"></a>

Whether you're on a budget, learning about deep learning, or just want to run a prediction service, you have many affordable options in the CPU category\. 

+ [Amazon EC2 C5 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/) have up to 72 Intel vCPUs\.

+ Amazon EC2 C4 Instances have up to 36 Intel vCPUs\.

+ Check out [EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) and look for **Compute Optimized** to see the different CPU instance options\.

**Note**  
C5 instances \(not available in all regions\) excel at scientific modelling, batch processing, distributed analytics, high\-performance computing \(HPC\), and machine/deep learning inference\.

**Note**  
If you plan to use Caffe on a Deep Learning AMI with Source Code \(CUDA 8\), you should choose a GPU instance instead\. Caffe on Deep Learning AMI with Source Code \(CUDA 8\) is built with GPU support, and cannot be run in CPU mode\.
